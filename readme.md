I <3 HACK, is the ideal application to find that better half you are looking for to plant your garden of love. An application with the function of finding that person related to you, do not get carried away only by physical appearance but you will complete a test to find the best possible compatibility with any user of the platform.
They say that love is blind ... let's check it then.
You also have the events tab available, where the places and the date will appear where you can spend a pleasant evening with a random person for a limited time, speed dating.
Your heart is a code, let them hack you.
